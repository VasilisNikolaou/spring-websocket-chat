# Spring-WebSocket-Chat
The WebSocket protocol defines an important new capability for web applications: full duplex, two-way communication between client and server.
Facebook's chat api uses websocket protocol, so i have been inspired to create something similar.
This is a real-time chat web application made with the help of Spring-WebSocket module. 
Users can send public/private messages to other active participants.


# What I Used

* Spring-WebSocket module
* Stomp over websocket protocol (as sub-protocol)
* SockJS (fallback options)
* LocalStorage (Singleton class)
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript (Embedded in .html file)
